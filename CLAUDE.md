# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A utility to convert Apple Health XML export data to CSV format. Licensed under CC0 1.0 (public domain).

**Important**: This tool is for entertainment purposes only. It is not intended for medical diagnosis, professional transcripts, or any medical purpose. There is no guarantee of conversion accuracy.

## Current State

This is a skeleton repository with no implementation code yet. It contains only a README.md and LICENSE file. The converter needs to be built from scratch.

## Intended Functionality

- Parse Apple Health XML export files (typically `export.xml` from iOS Health app)
- Convert health records to CSV format
